        <h1>Onigirazu Recipe</h1>

        <img src="../img/onigirazu.jpg" alt="Onigirazu Image"/>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Onigirazu is a rice ball (onigiri or omusubi in Japanese) that is NOT squeezed tightly into the traditional shape, like round or triangle.</p>

        <p>You can put more fillings inside, as the “rice ball” shape is square and you can spread the ingredients just like how you lay them out for a sandwich. You wrap the fillings from the four corners of nori. So it is kind of like “wrapped rice ball”.</p>
        

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 baked chicken katsu</li>
            <li>1–2 leaves green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed)</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1–2 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cut 1–2 leaves green cabbage into julienned slices.</li>
            <li>Place a plastic wrap on a working surface and put 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) on top (shiny side facing down), with a corner pointing up.</li>
            <li>Evenly spread about ½ cup cooked Japanese short-grain rice in a thin layer and form into a square shape in the center of nori sheet. Sprinkle ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. For Japanese rice ball (onigiri) that are enjoyed at room temperature, we add salt to the rice to keep the food fresh longer.</li>
            <li>Place the shredded cabbage evenly on top of rice and then 1 baked chicken katsu on top.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tsp Dijon mustard and 1–2 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce.</li>
            <li>Flip over chicken katsu so the sauce is also on the cabbage.</li>
            <li>Place another ½ cup steamed rice on top. Try to keep the square shape as you spread the rice evenly in a thin layer. Bring left and right corners of nori sheet towards the center. Fold gently but tightly to wrap around the layers at the center.</li>
            <li>Then bring the bottom and top corners towards the center. Continue to fold gently but tightly around the layers. Make sure the rice is tucked in nicely.</li>
            <li>If you like the onigirazu to showcase the filling after cutting in half, mark with a piece of shredded cabbage perpendicular to the filling. Wrap with plastic wrap tightly and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut the onigirazu with a sharp knife (following the direction of the “cabbage” mark). Run your knife in cold water before cutting so that the cross-section will be clean.</li>
        </ol>
