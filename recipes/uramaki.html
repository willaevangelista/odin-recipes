        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Sushi rolls, or ‘makizushi’ in Japanese, are what most non-Japanese people think of when they think of sushi. Makizushi is made by wrapping up fillings in rice and nori seaweed. This recipe shows you how to make a basic uramaki inside out sushi roll. Great for making multiple ones with your favourite fillings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>660g cooked japanese sushi rice</li>
            <li>50ml sushi vinegar</li>
            <li>1 long strip of sashimi grade fish</li>
            <li>1 long strip of cucumber</li>
            <li>1 sheet nori seaweed</li>
            <li>1 sprig dill</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp wasabi</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the sushi rice:</b> Moisten the inside of a sushi rice mixing bowl or a large bowl to prevent the rice from sticking. The rice needs to be freshly cooked and hot when preparing sushi rice. Place the 660g cooked japanese rice in the bowl and add the 50ml sushi vinegar. Gently mix the vinegar into the rice using a rice paddle until the vinegar is well incorporated. Let the sushi rice cool down to room temperature. Cover the sushi rice with a moistened tea towel to prevent the rice from drying out.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare the sushi seaweed:</b> Cut the1 sheet nori seaweed into halves, and then place half of the nori on the sushi mat shiny side down. As a golden rule, the shiny side of the nori seaweed should always be on the outside of the sushi.</li>
            <li><b>Roll the sushi:</b> Place roughly 110g of sushi rice on the nori seaweed and spread across evenly. Place the sprig of dill on the rice. Flip the nori seaweed and sushi rice so that the nori seaweed is facing upward. Add a small portion of wasabi and place the two strips of cucumber and sashimi grade fish in the centre. Start rolling from the bottom, tucking the edge of the roll to fully enclose the filling. Lift the edge of the mat and continue to roll forward until the sushi is formed into a firm cylinder.</li>
            <li><b>Cut the sushi:</b> Slightly wet the blade of a sharp knife and slice the roll into 6 pieces. First, slice it into halves and then the halves into thirds. Clean the knife with a wet towel between cuts to prevent the rice from sticking to the knife.</li>
            <li><b>Serve and enjoy:</b> Serve with soy sauce. Feel free to garnish with other foods such as white / black sesame seeds, tobiko, chives, etc.</li>
        </ol>
