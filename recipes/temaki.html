        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Temaki Sushi (手巻き寿司) is sometimes called a ‘hand roll’ because it consists of a rolled cone of seaweed wrapped around rice and fillings. The best part, for me as a cook, is that this is a meal where everyone helps themselves. You just need to prepare a platter of sushi rice, nori (seaweed sheet), and fillings such as sashimi-grade fish and veggie sticks. Then, at the table, each person makes hand-rolled sushi based on their favorite mix of ingredients. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>NVarious Ingredients for Hand Roll Sushi</li>
            <li>Nori (Seaweed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut a square nori sheet in half (restaurant-style) or quarter (more home-style) and place it, shiny side down, on your palm.</li>
            <li>Add a thin layer of sushi rice (about 2 tablespoons) to the left third of the nori sheet (if you‘re right-handed) and flatten/spread it evenly. Place some ingredients on the rice. Here, I put cucumber, takuwan, 1-2 types of sashimi, and radish sprouts.</li>
            <li>Roll the bottom left corner up to the middle of the top edge of the nori to form a triangle, and continue rolling until you form a cone shape.</li>
            <li>Put a piece of rice on the tip of the nori to secure the folds. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
