## About the Project

**Odin Recipes** is a basic HTML project created to practice fundamental web development skills.

The purpose of this repository is to build a small recipe website using only core technologies, focusing on:

* Proper HTML structure
* Semantic elements
* File organization
* Linking between pages
* Using images and lists correctly

This project is intentionally simple and does not use CSS frameworks or JavaScript. The goal is to strengthen foundational knowledge before moving on to more advanced tools.

The project contains the following pages:

* `index.html`
  The main page that lists and links to all recipes.

* `onigiri.html`
  Traditional Japanese rice ball recipe.

* `onigirazu.html`
  Sushi sandwich style recipe.

* `temaki.html`
  Hand rolled sushi cone recipe.

* `uramaki.html`
